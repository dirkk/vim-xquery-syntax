XQuery syntax file for VIM

Motivation: 

This syntax file differs from Jean Marc Vanel's syntax in that it doesn't use
the XML syntax as a base. I find the XML highlighting distracting when
programming; Since you're only working with snippets of XML at a time, I don't
think the XML highlighting helps.  Instead, the code structure is highlighted.
It's easy to spot variable references inside XML literals.  I try to stay close
to the C syntax highlighting. 

Background: 

The syntax file has been used while working on a 2000+ lines project with
numerous modules. The syntax file is by no means complete, but I think that
it's good enough to release.
